By fostering not only education but also awareness of the environment and sustainable energy management, Solare Zukunft addresses several of the SDGs within their projects at the same time. Through the concept of Solare Zukunft especially goals number 4 (Quality education), number 13 (climate action), and number 17 (partnerships for the goals) are addressed and focused as guidelines for the organization.

(Solare Zukunft, 2022) Making an actual place out of the ideas and principles would make the ideas of Solare Zukunft more known and more people could profit from the offers provided by the e.V. People would get easier access to education and space for developing their ideas, which is in direct relation with the principles for education.

Having a place where energy from different people can be packed and focused can lead to great ideas and will be easier and faster way to act within the energy and climate crisis. A Sustainability Hub could be a creative place to bring people together which are interested in the offers Solare Zukunft provides regarding solar energy as well as other topics related to climate change and a sustainable way of life. By cooperating with other local NGOs, synergy could be brought to life to make the concept a broader one with more interlinkages to combine different interests and knowledge. For example, an outdoor space could provide room for sustainable gardening and food processing. Also, this Hub could give a place to people who do not have one to develop their ideas. Having a house with a place for workshops, exhibitions, ideas, and everything would get people focusing on the challenges addressed by the SDGs and Solare Zukunft together. It would give room for people who want to contribute or gain knowledge. Sustainability is a topic that is addressed more and more in communities and in politics. Since climate change is accelerating and causing more and more problems the awareness of related topics is growing. In the future, significant changes and adaptations will be necessary. Sustainability hubs or similar projects can be a mechanism to educate the broader public and encourage sustainability in a meaningful and transformative way. (Millock, 2019) With the energy crisis people in Europe are facing right now, an accessible place to get information about this large and up-to-date topic and about possible ways to handle it would be a good opportunity for Solare Zukunft and the citizens of Freiburg.

(Solare Zukunft, 2022) In the context of educational offerings, Solare Zukunft has developed a concept of energy education, where young kids and students, as well as adults, can develop skills and acquire knowledge about how to deal with energy in a world confronted with climate change through different workshops proposed. The workshops are mostly given in schools, where the teaching of knowledge is addressed in different ways, always according to the needs of the group of participants taking part in the program. Solar panel construction, energy usage, and solar food processing are the main topics covered by the NGO. With regard to the current energy crisis, Solare Zukunft provides information and presentations on how anyone can save energy and actively participate in the development of sustainable energy management. For example, they provide information on how solar energy can be implemented on balconies, on house roofs, and in general how energy can be used in a more sustainable way. To share this knowledge with all interested parties and to provide people with energy competencies is the primary goal of the NGO. Furthermore, different projects are running, all connected to sustainable energy development and the propagation of knowledge, for example a bike cinema or cooking workshops. On top of the workshops and training proposals, Solare Zukunft has a development collaboration with different, sunny countries to build up the idea of Solar Food Processing in those countries. The goal is to give the opportunity to people to make money out of food processing by using solar energy. At the same time knowledge is spread out to these countries.

A lot of outdoor activities are possible within the surroundings of the city. These opportunities bring people closer to nature, if the will to do so is present.

It achieved this by passing important milestones, building its first solar apartment building in 1979, constructing the \"Heliotrop\" which is the first energy plus house in the world in 1994, founding the green city office in 2008, becoming the federal capital for climate change in 2010, refurbishing the world's first passive high rise building in 2011, setting several emissions reduction goals with the latest update in 2019 of 60% CO2 reduction by 2030 and 100% reduction by 2050 being voted in via citizen referendum, as well as many other milestones, giving it the title of \"green city\" (Green City Freiburg official webpage, n.d.). The \"green city\" identity and narrative of Freiburg therefore play a role in shaping its context and community, and it is in this context that the Sustainability Hub could be placed. The Sustainability Hub, which is the vision of Solare Zukunft, could be another milestone in advancing Freiburg's environmental practices and could contribute to it being a \"green city\". Solare Zukunft has already demonstrated to be in line with the vision and views of the city when it comes to environmental policy and ambition, by being members of the Freiburg world forum, as well as being members of the working group on nature and environmental education of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg (Solare Zukunft e.V. official webpage, n.d.-b) as well as being recognized by the German UNESCO commission (German UNESCO Commission webpage, n.d.). The Sustainability Hub embodies all of these ideals and therefore would be compatible within the context of Freiburg and its community, and could also be a potential new \u201cgreen city\u201d milestone for Freiburg. The city of Freiburg has committed to an important goal by setting the goal to reduce CO2 emissions by 60% by 2030 and by 100% completely by 2050 through the result of the citizens' referendum on the matter in 2019 (Freiburg city\u2019s official webpage, n.d.). This shows that the Freiburg community may be interested in environmental and sustainability initiatives. Therefore, the community may be interested in the Sustainability Hub\u2019s educational events and programs which are focused on sustainability and solar energy. Additionally, the effectiveness of environmentally aimed educational programs can be more effective when done in person, as would be offered in the Sustainability Hub. This is demonstrated when comparing a study in Poland, where a door-to-door environmental educational campaign which focused on promoting participation in official recycling schemes, showed promising results in terms of changing people's environmental lifestyle choices (Grodzi\u0144ska-Jurczak et al., 2006). On the other hand, online environmental educational campaigns may have limited effectiveness at changing lifestyles, as shown in a study which tried to evaluate an educational campaign on YouTube targeting younger audiences (Kaul et al., 2020). The Sustainability Hub would allow Solare Zukunft e.V. to expand access and continue to provide their various engaging and interactive educational programs in a dedicated and accessible space, programs such as a bicycle cinema, solar cooking, workshops, solar art and more (Solare Zukunft e.V. official webpage, n.d.-a). This variety of the educational programs offered by Solare Zukunft are conducted by a motivated and experienced team, are inclusive and are focused at promotion of a more sustainable lifestyle. This in turn would also help the Sustainability Hub to fit into the context of Freiburg and contribute to it being a \"green city\". The promotion of a sustainable lifestyle may also promote a more healthy lifestyle, and have an effect on various healthcare factors of the Freiburg population. It is by now widely accepted that the CO2 and other emissions are contributing both to climate change as well as to air pollution. The increased concentration of pollutants in the air and environment can lead to adverse health effects for the affected population (Orru et al., 2017). Additionally, as mentioned previously, effective environmental educational programs and environmental educational campaigns can lead to the adoption of more sustainable lifestyle choices. In this regard, the Sustainability Hub by Solare Zukunft could also contribute to improving the health of Freiburg\u2019s population and would promote its high living standards.","title":"Target Market & Positioning"},{"location":"02_Market_Analysis/market_positioning/#22-target-market-positioning","text":"The city of Freiburg has become known for advanced environmental practices and high living standards.

The Sustainability Hub embodies all of these ideals and therefore would be compatible within the context of Freiburg and its community, and could also be a potential new \u201cgreen city\u201d milestone for Freiburg. The city of Freiburg has committed to an important goal by setting the goal to reduce CO2 emissions by 60% by 2030 and by 100% completely by 2050 through the result of the citizens' referendum on the matter in 2019 (Freiburg city\u2019s official webpage, n.d.). This shows that the Freiburg community may be interested in environmental and sustainability initiatives. Therefore, the community may be interested in the Sustainability Hub\u2019s educational events and programs which are focused on sustainability and solar energy. Additionally, the effectiveness of environmentally aimed educational programs can be more effective when done in person, as would be offered in the Sustainability Hub. This is demonstrated when comparing a study in Poland, where a door-to-door environmental educational campaign which focused on promoting participation in official recycling schemes, showed promising results in terms of changing people's environmental lifestyle choices (Grodzi\u0144ska-Jurczak et al., 2006). On the other hand, online environmental educational campaigns may have limited effectiveness at changing lifestyles, as shown in a study which tried to evaluate an educational campaign on YouTube targeting younger audiences (Kaul et al., 2020). The Sustainability Hub would allow Solare Zukunft e.V. to expand access and continue to provide their various engaging and interactive educational programs in a dedicated and accessible space, programs such as a bicycle cinema, solar cooking, workshops, solar art and more (Solare Zukunft e.V. official webpage, n.d.-a). This variety of the educational programs offered by Solare Zukunft are conducted by a motivated and experienced team, are inclusive and are focused at promotion of a more sustainable lifestyle. This in turn would also help the Sustainability Hub to fit into the context of Freiburg and contribute to it being a \"green city\". The promotion of a sustainable lifestyle may also promote a more healthy lifestyle, and have an effect on various healthcare factors of the Freiburg population. It is by now widely accepted that the CO2 and other emissions are contributing both to climate change as well as to air pollution. The increased concentration of pollutants in the air and environment can lead to adverse health effects for the affected population (Orru et al., 2017). Additionally, as mentioned previously, effective environmental educational programs and environmental educational campaigns can lead to the adoption of more sustainable lifestyle choices. In this regard, the Sustainability Hub by Solare Zukunft could also contribute to improving the health of Freiburg\u2019s population and would promote its high living standards.","title":"2.2 Target Market &amp; Positioning"},{"location":"03_Marketing_Strategy/marketing/","text":"3. Social Media Marketing Strategy One of the most effective ways for marketing is the use of social media marketing and each of the companies including NGOs are successfully setting crowdfunding, organizing events, financing their projects, increasing brand awareness and also building relationships with customers or their audience, only by using the social media marketing. Based on this fact, a marketing strategy could also help Solare Zukunft to be promoted around their target audience, to generate more people to be part of the mission, people who would like to share the same goal. Many of the NGOs that share the same spectrum of activity as Solare Zukunft use social media marketing that is mainly promoted in Facebook, Instagram and Twitter but none of them are on TikTok. This opportunity gives Solare Zukunft the benefits of being ahead on this social media network and to create something unique for the mission. TikTok is a creative short video social software, which is a music short video community based on contemporary young people and the users of this software can create their favorite short videos with music and special effects. According to statistics, among the user groups of TikTok, 68.7% are less than 24 years old, and 73.69 are less than 30 years old and that means that people with Tik Tok are mainly after \u201995 or even after \u201900 (Shuai Yang et al., 2019). It is available in over 150 countries, has over 1 billion users and over the 2019 and its revenues grew over 300%, passing Twitter and Snapchat combined. Now it is the 7th in terms of social network sites ahead of LinkedIn, Twitter, Snapchat, with 90% of all TikTok users using the app on daily basis and spending an average of 52 minutes per day (Brandon Doyle, 2022). 68% of Tik Tok users watch someone else\u2019s video and 55% of them upload their own videos (Chris Beer, 2019). Putting all of this into perspective, it took Instagram six years from its launch to gain the same number of monthly active users that TikTok managed to achieve in under three years, on the other hand for Facebook it took the best part of four years (Alison Battisby, 2021). 3.1 Utilization of TikTok for Solare Zukunft For Solare Zukunft, TikTok would give more possibilities to go viral because it prioritizes videos from creators that were never seen before, so the audience may see videos just by randomly scrolling, contrary to Facebook or Instagram which consists of contents from people or channels you already follow. The other TikTok marketing strategies include the creation of trend-driven organic content, using popular hashtags and incorporating TikTok influencers into promotional campaigns. Most important when creating a TikTok account is to identify and to target the audience needed based on age, location, interest, language. For Solare Zukunft the target group is mainly children and students and also adults, teachers/pedagogues to whom they offer training, so the common interest is sustainability. Being the first NGO using TikTok to promote their mission, the advantage of creating something unique and interesting videos that could help this community to understand the mission, could also encourage people to be part of the mission. To promote the community the option of paid advertisements can be used in order to reach more users, to reach specific targeted demographics of users. On the other hand, according to Statista (2022), the global influencer marketing space has more than doubled since 2019 to $13.8 billion in 2021, which means other than paid advertisement, a cooperation with sustainable influencers plays a major role in community promotion. At this point, it is mandatory to define if we want the mission to be global or only focused in the local community. Focusing on the local community, a good cooperation could be with the young student and environmental protectionist Marvin R\u00fcb, a 20 years old, who is mainly focused on the German speaking audience and interested to promote and cooperate with every project that would save the environment and nature. His posts on TikTok account @rescueplanetlife are very interesting and provide a message on how to raise the awareness of people to protect the environment and nature. 3.2 Community Engagement To make people join the mission, a well-constructed email or an invitation to the list of prospective members of the Solare Zukunft\u2019s existing community should be sent in which a link for the TikTok account should be attached. A short-video in which the objectives of the mission are clearly stated, can be used as a welcoming video, keeping it always short and meaningful. This video will also give the members a sense of transparency. Another way to invite people is to visit blogs, groups and forums where the target audience is likely to be around and just drop the URL of the TikTok account, for example in Sustainability Portal provided by Green City Freiburg. Introducing ourselves and joining the conversation with other sustainable members could be also helpful. Once a community is established, inviting members casually to take a look at the content or a post that has been made in the TikTok account could be helpful as a promoting strategy. To facilitate the sharing of the TikTok community, asking close friends and family is also an option. Making posters or cards with QR link that would immediately direct the people who are interested to the TikTok account, and put them in poster-boards like Sustainable University Work Group in Albert-Ludwigs-Universit\u00e4t Freiburg. In order to give a first good impression, updating the description which should capture the community in one quick read, profile photo, which should be the most visible thing and a warm message video pinned to the top of the homepage is a great way to welcome new followers. To keep the community active, key performance indicators for member\u2019s growth and engagement, for instance observing the total number of users, new users in the past, user growth over the month is also needed. Noting how many total engagements we have, how many posted comments, what is the percentage of total users liked or commented in a month could help the mission to understand how the community is expanding day to day. To keep the community engaged, a good idea would be the creation of a theme for each day or in every two-three days of the week with topics that are fit to discuss and that would help with the development of the mission by raising questions as a way to spark discussion. At this point the mission tries to build a two-way relationship, interacting with the audience because people are more likely to return when we acknowledge their presence, for example giving them as reward T-shirts with the Solare Zukunft\u2019s logo, giving them free tours around the sustainability hub. To also promote the sustainability hub, one simple way can be using hashtags, which are short and easy, it can be used in each video. Weekly, creating a short video to the audience and letting them know what is going on in the community, highlighting the new members and giving the community heads up to the re-upcoming events or promotion, creating short videos explaining why the projects are important and how could the people of Freiburg benefit from it, will be a good way to promote and to engage the community. Also creating videos that will show to other users that Solare Zukunft is trying daily to improve; letting them join on different polls and give users the idea that they are part of the community, and their little help is helping the mission to improve daily. Using the \u201clive option\u201d and trying to engage with the community, can also help to collect tips from the audience. To include a bigger audience trying the option of \u201cGo Pro\u201d will allow to get more interactions. In order for the audience to get more of the idea of the solar energy showing the project in action is beneficial, like doing videos on how it helps the community to save energy, highlighting how the project fits a sustainable lifestyle and how it is a great way to get noticed in higher steps. To give the audience the feeling that they are part of the mission, going behind the scenes with videos and showing them on record what we does Solare Zukunft in daily basis, like showing the offices, daily practices, highlighting every partnership with green vendors, trying to cooperate with institution and companies that also have the same goals inside the city of Freiburg like Albert-Ludwigs-Universit\u00e4t Freiburg with its departments like The Centre for Renewable Energy, The Department of Sustainable Systems Engineering (INATECH), institutes like The Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems (ISE), Klimapartner Oberrhein, \u00d6kostrom Erzeugung Freiburg GmbH (Freiburg Convention Bureau, 2022) would help the mission go further. Other partners of Freiburg city like Die Agentur Innovation Academy, Aiforia, Freiburg Future Lab and OSM are some possible chances to cooperate with them and to show the idea. The big idea is to always have an idea on what the mission wants to show to the audience, posting consistently which means mastering some of the trends that are currently on TikTok and try to do something similar which would increase the curiosity of the audience to look up into the mission. Keeping the audience engaged and hopefully increasing is a creative and continuous cycle in order to work in the finest way.","title":"Marketing Strategy"},{"location":"03_Marketing_Strategy/marketing/#3-social-media-marketing-strategy","text":"One of the most effective ways for marketing is the use of social media marketing and each of the companies including NGOs are successfully setting crowdfunding, organizing events, financing their projects, increasing brand awareness and also building relationships with customers or their audience, only by using the social media marketing.

Keeping the audience engaged and hopefully increasing is a creative and continuous cycle in order to work in the finest way.","title":"3.2 Community Engagement"},{"location":"04_Location_Strategy/activities/","text":"4.1 Activities 4.1.1 Bycicle Cinema, Disco and Games One of the unique activities that Solare Zukunft offers is the use of bicycles, that are hooked up to a setup in order to convert the kinetic energy produced by those bikes into electrical energy and thus powering all the necessary equipment to watch movies or party at a disco or even play video games. The process is fairly similar for all of these; the bicycle cinema has 10 cyclists, who generate electricity for the projector, laptop and sound system at the same time, thus enabling a network-independent cinema experience, whereas the bicycle discos does it with 5 to 7 bicycles powering the sound system and disco lighting. As for the bicycle games the software that acts as the interface to the audience is being redesigned in this project. Here, it is equipped with masks. Each mask allows a different view of the generated energy/power. This means that performance can be displayed cumulatively, individually, or as a whole. And this results in the possibility of games in the form of competitions, simulating load curves, making energy and performance understandable through experience, or making it possible to experience the energy content of food or consumer goods. All of this is 100% self-sufficient in energy, leading to an increasing appreciation of electrical energy and thus sensitizing for a more responsible use. Lastly, the setup and condition of the bikes are of great importance, especially for the use of proper layout. Two trained people are required to set up and operate the bicycle activities. Setup and test run take about 2 hours, dismantling about an hour. The quality of the bikes is important, the gears must work well, there should be no eight or radial wobble in the wheels and no mountain bike profile should be fitted, otherwise a lot of energy is lost through friction and the running noise is too loud. It is important to ensure that a suitable floor is available. On the one hand, the roller trainers need non-slip contact, and, on the other hand, the floor should not be too sensitive. Non-slip underlays may be required. 4.1.2 Experiments about environmentally friendly mobility/traffic and renewable energies One of the most important and favorable groups that is invited to participate in all these interactive and fun learning activities are small children. To better understand what changes our planet is going through and some of the possible solutions for them, in the context of climate change, energy saving and renewable energies, experiments are carried out on the various renewable energies: photovoltaics, solar thermal energy, wind energy and hydropower. Furthermore, a similar workshop that tries to convey the connection between combustion engines, CO2 emissions and climate change, takes place to teach small children about environmentally friendly ways of getting around. With the help of solar cars, air-powered cars, steamboats, the children can try out and observe different drive options themselves. While they experiment themselves with the possibilities of various renewable energies, they can even generate electricity for the electric train on an energy bicycle. 4.1.3 Building plug in and balcony solar devices Solar energy is arguably the most abundant source of renewable energy and possibly the easiest to exploit. So, what\u2019s better than teaching people how to build their own balcony solar system? After a lecture on the fascination of solar energy and on the technical, economic, and legal aspects of plug-in solar systems, an exclusive live workshop takes place on upcycling used solar modules into new balcony solar devices, with plugs, cables, micro-inverters, and solar modules being prepared and installed. There is hope to make the possibility of building new balcony solar devices from used solar modules accessible to an even broader public. 4.1.4 Solar food processing Solare Zukunft emphasizes a lot on sustainable energy and especially on the effective use of solar energy. As a result, there is a need to identify the most effective solar processing technologies and products in terms of quality and cost effectiveness. One of the areas that they are trying to penetrate is the food market by exploiting developed technologies and using clean energy when producing or conserving food. 4.1.5 Solar cooking and baking and solar dehydrators Solare Zukunft educates people how to build solar cooking boxes and dehydrators as well as display different types of solar cooker models. The solar cooking box is a wooden box with thermal insulation. The inner sheet metal is black to absorb the sun\u2019s rays, which fall through the glass cover. When properly aligned the crate can reach temperatures of up to 150 degrees. There is, also, the parabolic mirror cooker, which, when correctly aligned, concentrates the sun\u2019s rays to a focal point in the middle. With the use of both systems, anyone can cook stew, make popcorn, or fry eggs, while also bake bread or cakes, cook rice, potatoes and more. Then there is the solar dehydrator, a tunnel under a film on a black background, where fruits and vegetables can be dried in about 10 hours, provided the sun is shining. While the cooking is occurring, the theoretical background, the social and cultural significance of the use of solar energy in countries of the South, but especially in Central European latitudes, the economic and ecological advantages, and the practical functionality of the solar cooking box are explained, making this an unforgettable and memorable experience. 4.1.6 Arts and Crafts A workshop where people of all ages, especially children, can come by and work with materials like wood and clay to create something out of the earth. This way people can spend time outdoors making something with their own hands from natural materials, therefore getting closer and appreciating the earth and planet more. Those creations can be decorative or practical, to be used as cups and utensils for an organic caf\u00e9, located inside the Sustainability Hub. They can also be simple toys for the children to play with and even be modified to fit in the \u201csolar powered toys\u201d workshop that Solare Zukunft hosts. Lastly, anything that takes shape within this workshop could be later exhibited in a flea market that again takes place in the Sustainability Hub. 4.1.7 Flea Market It would be interesting if every week or month a sustainable flea market takes place in the premises of the sustainability hub. What makes it sustainable? It will promote sustainability in the sense that anything that is sold or exchanged is recyclable, from used clothes to second-hand books and toys. As it was mentioned above, creations from the \u201carts and Crafts\u201d workshop can be exhibited here. A variety of seeds and starter plants that come from the sustainable garden of the Sustainability Hub can be sold or given to people, who would like to start their own garden at home. The benefits of hosting a flea market are the strengthening of the community, the suggestion that not everything needs to be bought brand new but rather reused and the conclusion that activities like these, which aim to promote sustainability and recycling, help the planet. 4.1.8 Organic Cafe An amazing opportunity to make the Sustainability Hub an actual Hub, where people get together, hang out, and join in the activities/festivities while learning in the process is the inclusion of an \u201cOrganic Caf\u00e9\u201d. This caf\u00e9 should be fully sustainable, showcasing that it is achievable in reality and not just a concept. It can be powered by solar panels on a sunny day or a generator that is hooked to bikes, converting kinetic energy to electric. The water that is going to be used, will come from tanks of rainwater that will be filtered to become drinkable. Food and baked goods, made from the solar cooking workshop can be displayed here. The cups, glasses bowls, plates, and utensils will be made by the people of the community as already mentioned from wood and clay. The caf\u00e9 itself should be in the form of a shack/booth or the inside kitchen can be modified to serve both purposes. It would be nice if a small group of tables and chairs is available, but the idea is that most of the people can take a stroll with their order through the garden, sitting on a bench, and enjoying the nature surrounding them. 4.1.9 General once-in-a-while festivities Given the open and available space that The Sustainability Hub provides, it can host itself various festivities other than workshops. With the Organic Caf\u00e9 up and running, the beautiful sustainable garden surrounding the area, and hundreds of people crowding the place the Sustainability Hub could arrange small-scale concerts, solar art exhibitions, theatre plays or even interactive theatre and musical \u201cworkshops\u201d, elevating itself from a unique, different, and sustainable school to an entertaining and fun Hub where anyone in Freiburg can join not only to learn but socialize as well.","title":"Activities"},{"location":"04_Location_Strategy/activities/#41-activities","text":"","title":"4.1 Activities"},{"location":"04_Location_Strategy/activities/#411-bycicle-cinema-disco-and-games","text":"One of the unique activities that Solare Zukunft offers is the use of bicycles, that are hooked up to a setup in order to convert the kinetic energy produced by those bikes into electrical energy and thus powering all the necessary equipment to watch movies or party at a disco or even play video games.

Sustainable gardening encourages greater biodiversity by creating habitats for pollinators and beneficial insects, allowing respectful coexistence with native wildlife. Sustainable farming methods affect the environment in a positive way and contribute to the well-being and quality of people's lives by providing cleaner air, healthier produce free of pesticides because of healthier soil, and have been proven to have a therapeutic effect. Horticultural activities improve the social, educational, psychological, and physical adjustment of persons to improve their body, mind, and spirit (SaferBrand, n.d.). Additionally, a study found gardening regularly, caused a decreased risk for dementia by 36-47% (Simons et al., 2016). Gardening counts as a moderate-intensity exercise, which reduces heart attack odds by 30% for people over 60 years old (Min Zhao et al., 2019). It is evident why sustainable farming/gardening plays a crucial role in every aspect of the pursuit of sustainability in everyone\u2019s everyday lives. The Sustainability Hub needs a garden to match its green approach and help present itself as a place where protecting nature and promoting biodiversity matter. In addition, the presence of a garden in the Hub assists in attracting people, having an outdoor space where activities can be held, and benefiting the community that engages themselves with it. There are a lot of different fields of sustainable farming/gardening. Those that can be implemented best, but not limited to, on the Sustainability Hub\u2019s specific setting are permaculture, agrivoltaics, agroforestry, and organic farming. 4.3.1 Permaculture Permaculture is a system that mimics how vegetables and plants grow in natural ecosystems. Its purpose is to apply smart farming and design to reduce waste of resources and increase production efficiency. Two of the various techniques in permaculture include herb and plant spirals, and h\u00fcgelkultur beds, as it was listed earlier. (Hortidaily, 2019) Herb spirals are a circular bed with spiraled walls that creates an extreme collection of microclimates, with varying degrees of sun exposure, drainage, and the opportunity to separate bad companions and neighbor friendly plants. It, also, fosters biodiversity and provides habitat for pollinators and other beneficial wildlife, such as birds, bats, and bees. (Engels, 2014) Whereas h\u00fcgelkultur beds try, once again, to mimic the growth of plants in a forest by burying beneath the soil logs and twigs, thus providing the plants with fertile soil and excellent water absorption and retention. (Greentumble, 2016) 4.3.2 Agrivoltaic Secondly, agrivoltaic farming makes a very interesting practice considering the focus of stakeholders Solare Zukunft, being solar energy. Agrivoltaics is the practice of growing crops underneath solar panels. One of the most obvious advantages that is presented with this field is saving space by utilizing the same area of land to obtain both solar energy and agricultural products. This coexistence of solar panels with crops on the same surface, provides shade to the latter reducing temperatures and preventing evaporation, while also leading to the protection of the plants from all possible atmospheric phenomena. (IBERDROLA, n.d.) Another thing to note is that solar panels are inherently temperature sensitive: as they get hotter, their efficiency decreases. Growing certain species under the photovoltaic panels allows us to reduce the temperature of the panels keeping them efficient. (CESPA, 2022) 4.3.3 Agroforestry As for agroforestry, the only issue is that its realization depends on the location of the \u201cSustainability Hub\" being near a forest. However, if that is covered, the mixture of trees or shrubs into the land provide shade and shelter, like solar panels did in agrivoltaics, that protect plants, animals, and water resources. The system mimics natural forest ecosystems, and it's designed to make effective use of the available land. Compared to traditional farming systems, agroforestry can double crop yields and significantly decrease the need for chemical fertilizers or pesticides. (Hortidaily, 2019) 4.3.4 Organic Farming Finally, there is organic farming. While it is self-explanatory, organic farming is in a way the parent of every forementioned field. It combines most of these practices plus some others like cover crops and perennials or reducing the use of tillage. In general, organic gardening differs from traditional gardening in the way that it rejects the use of all artificial agricultural chemicals, including pesticides used to control insects, diseases and weeds. This can be further assisted by releasing or providing habitat for populations of beneficial insects (such as ladybugs, lacewings, and fly parasites), as well as encouraging other organisms to thrive (such as birds and bats) that will serve as predators of crop-eating pest insects. (Greentumble, 2015) There is little doubt that organic gardening improves soils because of the emphasis on increasing soil organic matter, leading to improved soil tilth and structure, and improved water retention. It succeeds in these by making use of what was mentioned earlier; cover crops, which are planted during off-season times when soils might otherwise be left bare, and perennial crops, that keep soil covered and maintain living roots in the ground year-round.

Therefore, to enable the project by Solare Zukunft of a \u201cSustainability Hub\u201d in Freiburg solid funding is needed. In the first place to enable capital procurement for the \u201cSustainability Hub\u201d, it is useful to create a detailed concept of the project, which is done through a business plan. To evaluate capital procurement methods as part of the financial plan of the business plan it is important to contour the general conditions, including the cost estimations of the premises and the consequential revenue. Normally a financial plan contains the current monetary situation and all long-term monetary goals, the strategies to achieve the goals, as well as the expected cost for the setup (McKeever 2018). Since Solare Zukunft only requested a \u201crough\u201d Business Plan for the \u201cSustainability Hub\u201d to give possible investors an idea of the project, the financial plan with its capital procurement methods is kept more as an overview and elaboration than a strict plan. The premises of the \u201cSustainability Hub\u201d will create costs that can be divided into fixed and variable costs as shown in Figure 1. While the variable costs mainly consist of maintenance costs and operational costs, the fixed costs will include property costs, planning costs, building costs, and others. It can be expected that the variable costs can be financed by current revenue like leasing the premises for events, conferences, and meetings. Whereas the fixed costs primarily must be financed from investors, donators, sponsors, etc. \u2013 capital procurement methods. Solare Zukunft stated two options for the premises \u2013 either an existing building or a new one. If an existing premise is found the cost estimation is highly dependent on the conditions on-site. Therefore, only the cost determination of a new building will be contoured in the following, even if renovations can use the same bases. Since overestimating and underestimating the cost of construction can be crucial for a project and accuracy in cost estimation is important for a successful project, the construction costs for the \u201cSustainability Hub\u201d should be estimated. Common cost drivers for construction include Materials, Services, Equipment, and Labor (Ashworth & Perera 2015). With increasing volatility in supply chains an increasing amount of capital should be available for these kinds of uncertainties (Rice & Klibi et al. 2022) as well as for building \u201cgreen\u201d since the linking between capital cost and building \u201cgreen\u201d is still a field of current research (Rehm & Ade 2013). To get insights into how other organizations are financing themselves and their projects extensive market research of associations with a close thematic focus to \u201cSolare Zukunft\u201d around Freiburg [linking to the analysis] has been done. It is observable that the investigated organizations use different methods to finance themselves. Figure 2 shows a word cloud of the financing methods. The font size indicates the appearance of a single word in our research. From the market research extracted Word-Cloud indicates that the reviewed NGOs mainly use three different methods donations, membership, and sponsoring. Therefore, in the following, only the three major methods will be viewed. A membership Organization is an organization that allows people to subscribe, with often a membership fee. Membership organizations have the purpose of connecting people around an activity, domain, interest, industry, or geographical location (American Society of Association Executives 2016). Besides collecting monetary capital, a membership also pools social capital from all members which are beneficial for every single participating person (Larance 2001). Donations can be either monetary or other resources like services or goods. Recurring, One-off, or Volunteering are three common types of donations. While recurring donations usually are small monetary amounts from long-term allies, one-off donations are single higher monetary amounts that appear usually in highly visual events. Volunteering as a service donation commonly appears in form of a workforce for a period. Sponsorship as a capital procurement method is considerable like donations. The difference is that the givers (sponsors) usually corporations want something in return for their sponsoring while donors come more from the philanthropic nature of humanity and do not expect something in return. The two main types of sponsorship are financial and fundraising sponsorship. While Financial Sponsorship can be characterized as regular agreements that support the non-profit organization for the time of the agreement, fundraising sponsorship can be events or campaigns for raising money. Depending on the needs and the structure of the organization the focus on each capital procurement method can differ (Martin 2022). In the underlying market research, none of the investigated non-profit organizations named crowdfunding as a financing method for their projects or the organization itself. Even though the expected average funding per Campagna in Germany is growing (Statista Research Department 2022), which indicates that the probability of crowdfunded projects is also increasing. Crowdfunding is a collective cooperation by people who network and interact, and raise capital together, usually via the internet, to support efforts by other people or organizations (Lawton & Marom 2010). Crowdfunding is a unique method of collecting hundreds of thousands of dollars for one\u2019s own investors or securing funding for extremely innovative ideas. This form of financing is gaining popularity beyond its funding function, and crowdfunding is being used to market innovative projects, beyond money-raising purposes (Belleflamme & Lambert et al. 2013), which could be beneficial for the project of a \u201cSustainability Hub\u201d since an increased range of possible interested people in a certain project can help the project itself (Fichtel 2019). Some even say that \u201cCrowdfunding is the next step in the world\u2019s progress towards a globalized society promoting cultural and geographical diversification, towards pacification and education of all people, towards economic stability and equality\u201d (Br\u00fcntje & Gajda 2016). Crowdfunding as the concept of exploiting a large number of people, and investing small amounts of money to carry out capital-intensive tasks was born in Germany during the seventeenth century. In 1884 the American Committee raised over $100.000 for the Statue of Liberty\u2019s pedestal from over 160.000 donors. With the internet, crowdfunding campaigns enable even more benefits of visibility and feedback. (Br\u00fcntje & Gajda 2016) For associations, there are two main types of crowdfunding \u2013 classic and donation-oriented since no shares are to be sold. In classical crowdfunding, the investors receive a non-monetary appreciation for their support. The investor is primarily interested in the results of the project and personal profit if the project is successful. For donation-oriented crowdfunding, the donors receive nothing in return. (Mennig 2020) The reason is more from philanthropic nature, supporting social projects and organizations. To answer the question of whether crowdfunding is successful it is appropriate to have a look at the latest \u201cGlobal Alternative Finance Market Benchmarking Report\u201d from 2019 For the European Union and United Kingdom, a classic volume of \u20ac158.8 million with a success rate of 66% and a donation-oriented volume of \u20ac53.14 million with a success rate of 69% was determined. A successful crowdfunding campaign in Germany could be even higher since the risk for campaign fraud is 15% lower compared to the average. (Wenzlaff & Britney Wang et al. 2020). Since digital marketing reduces the cost per person or visit to reach interested parties (Poddar & Agarwal 2019), crowdfunding could be an efficient way for Solare Zukunft and their project to reach funders and as a side effect increase the level of recognition not only for citizens of the city of Freiburg but also for visitors. Known crowdfunding webpages for associations are for example: \u201cfairplaid.org\u201d \u201cbetterplace.org\u201d To perform a crowdfunding project reaching the funding goal several things can increase the probability of success. A study of 500 Kickstarter.com projects tried to find predictors that can help reach the funding goal of a crowdfunding initiative. One result of the study was that the presence of a video explaining the project\u2019s features highly correlated with a higher probability of success. In contrast, setting a too-high funding goal lowers the success rate. The study also discovered that the presence of special offers for early investors and showing commitment to the platform by helping other projects are two good mediators influencing the relationship between the number of purchases of the project and the rate of funding. (Br\u00fcntje & Gajda 2016) It can be expected that the project of a \u201cSustainability Hub\u201d with its premises-, property-, etc. cost will be high and therefore challenging to finance. Aside from the more traditional procurement methods sponsorship, membership, and donations, it is recommendable to also include crowdfunding in the overall financing plan. As above mentioned, the success of reaching the funding goal correlates with the high of the goal \u2013 hence splitting the project up into smaller sub-goals could increase the financing by the crowd. The local limitation of the project can be captured as a burden for inter-/national funders since then the motivation is only of philanthropic nature. Reacting to this challenge possible funders could receive some sort of non-physical credit like an online workshop for installing solar panels on their balconies. As a Side effect crowdfunding could also increase the overall visibility of Solare Zukunft internationally and therefore also for tourists visiting the city of Freiburg which again would increase the overall visibility. Nonetheless, it is most likely that donations and sponsorship will be the driving capital procurement methods for financing the \u201cSustainability Hub\u201d. However, beyond the financial part membership and especially crowdfunding shows the higher potential of interaction with people, which is crucial to ensure the human-centric alignment and make the place vibrant and well implemented into the urban context.","title":"Financial Strategy"},{"location":"06_Conclusion/conclusion/","text":"Conclusion In conclusion, the Sustainability Hub is an innovative and exciting project that aims to promote solar energy and sustainability in the community of Freiburg.
